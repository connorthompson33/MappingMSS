# MappingMSS
This is the master repository for all the manuscript descriptions and data files involved in the Mapping Systems of Manuscripts project initiated by A.R. Bennett

Manuscript Descriptions are written in JSON so that they are both human and machine readable, database ready, and prepared for Linked Open Data.
