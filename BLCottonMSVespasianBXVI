"SkeatDesc":"MS. Cotton, Vespasian B. Xvi, in the British Museum; the eraliest and best of the MSS. Of the poem (in whatever shape), in the British Mesuem, written on vellum before 1400; collated throughout, and denoted by the letter M. Each leaf measures about 10 inches by 7 1/4, and the MS. Consists of 95 leaves. Each page contains about 40 lines. The copy of Piers the Plowman begins on leaf 6, and ends on leaf 95 recto. The metrical pause is denoted throughout by a large red dot. The poem is divided into paragraphs, which are denoted by paragraph marks (❡) prefixed, coloured red and blue alternately, and every paragraph ends with a waved red line. All the Latin quotations are written in red letters. On the first five leaves, and on the last page, are written various pieces, some of them imperfect, in a later hand, probably about A.D. 1416 or later, as that date is found on leaf 5. These pieces are printed in Mr Wright’s edition of Political Songs; Camden Society, 1839. One of them, a Satirical Proclamation, will be found in Mr Furnivall’s Political, Religious, and Love Poems (E.E.T.S., 1866), pp. 12 and 13. This is the piece which is dated A.D. 1416, but there are reasons for supposing this date a mere mistake for 1436; see the note in Mr. Furnivall’s volume. But all these pieces have clearly been written in afterwards, and the date of them does not affect the date of the copy of Piers the Plowman. As I was unable to give up my time to visiting the British Museum very frequently, my collation has been made by help of the transcript made for me, as I have already mentioned, by Mr. Rossiter, Mr Brock, and Mr Wood. My thanks are also specially due to Miss L. Toulmin Smith,  of this volume once more with theMS., in order to eliminate any small errors that might otherwise have arisen. Every reading of M that is of any consequence has been recorded in the footnotes.
The MS. Is not so good, as regards the character of its readings, as might have been expected. My attempt to make it the basis of the text entirely broke down. In many places where it differs from MS. P, the variations are certainly for the worse, although it has always proved worth consulting, and is the only MS. Which gives l. 116 of Pass. xviii., thus completing the otherwise imperfect sentence. In the course of my work, I discovered a fact which no one seems to have suspected, viz. that one leaf is missing, which ought to contain the passage C.xix. 245—xx.30; and in another place, the subject-matter has been misplaced in a very puzzling manner: so that, on these accounts also, it is very fortunate that it was not taken as the basis of the text. After C.xviii.186, M inserts xviii.288; then comes xviii.187; then xviii.259-287; then xviii.188-258; after which comes xviii.289, and all the rest of the Passus. Nothing is lost by this arrangement, but it is not easy to follow or to explain, and it considerably injures the sense. The completeness of the collation with M renders it hardly necessary to say more; but it may be remarked that this MS. Should not be put in the same sub-class with P, E, and Z, nor with I, T, and B but in a third class, along with F and S. An account of the sub-classes will be found below, in sect. 6. ",
