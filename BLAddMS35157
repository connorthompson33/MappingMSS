Medical recipes added on a flyleaf in a hand of the late 15th or 16th century (f. 124v).
Robert Machell, his name inscribed in a ?15th century hand (f. 125v)
Parchment scraps have been pasted in on ff. 9-11 where part of the original folio is missing with the text supplied in the 16th-century hand of Thomas Thyrnbeke whose name is inscribed on f. 124v. The added text is from either the second or third of Robert Crowley's 1550 editions of Piers Plowman.
Arthur Surteys (Suttees): his name inscribed in a ?16th-century hand (f. 124r).
William Aiscoughe, his name inscribed in a ?16th-century hand (f. 124r).
Francis Aiscoughe, of Cottam, Nottinghamshire, a paste-down note from a former binding (numbered as f. 1), transcribed in 1728, states: 'This Book was written and dated the 10th of the Ides of March the 2nd yeare of King John of famous memory by Peers Plowman Pensionaire or rather Servant to the said K[in]g as John Gowere recordeth. 9th Fraun' Aiscoughe'; his name inscribed on f. 124r and f.124v in a hand of the 17th century.

A portrait bust of a young man in profile, painted in colours in an oval gold frame, perhaps the work of Maurice Johnson or one of his heirs (f. 6r).
Mrs Johnson, through the Johnson family by inheritance: bought from her by the British Museum on 7 January 1898 (a note on f. [ii]).

From the British Museum Catalogue of Additions (1901): 'THE VISION of William concerning Piers the Plowman, together with Dowell, Dobet and Dobest. The latest version, called the "C" text by Skeat, Early English Text Society ed., 1873. Begins: "In a somer sesonn when soft was þe sonne I shoep me in to shrowdes as y a shep were." Piers Plowman ends at f. 54 b, "Explicit visio Willelmi W. de Petro le ploughman. Et hic incipit visio eiusdem de dowel." Dobet begins at f. 87 b without heading and ends at f. 110, "Explicit dobet et incipit dobest." At the end of Dobest (f. 124), "Explicit liber vocatlis Pers ploghman"; followed by the name (of the scribe?) "Preston" in red. The MS. is not mentioned by Skeet. It closely, resembles Lord Ilchester's MS. (Skeat's I, see his edition, pp. xxxiii.-xxxviii., and footnotes, passim ); agreeing with it in the colophon to Piers Plowman, in the titles to the several "passus," and in a large proportion of the variations from the standard text adopted by Skeat. The following dialectical characteristics may be noted:-
(a) the pronoun I is almost invariably written y , not I c or I ch; (b) she is generally so written, not hue or heo; (c) the past participle usullly has the prefix y -. On a blank page at the end (f. 124 b) are two medical recipes, "contra stipacionem ventris is que vocatur grind," and "to dissolue the hernia carnosa," inserted in the 16th cent. Vellum; ff. 125. End of XIVth cent. Initials in red and blue; the Latin pasages underlined in red. A few lines lost by the mutilation of f. 9, and a few words on ff. 10 and 11; but the missing passages supplied, circ . 1500. Marginal notes in various hands of the 16th and 17th centt. The following names, presumably of former owners, occur: Arthur Surteys (f. 124); Thomas Thyrnbeke, "Clarke" (f. 124b, 16th cent.); Francis Aiscoughe, of Cottam [eo. Notts] (ff. 1, 124, 124b, 16-17th cent.); and Maurice Johnson, of Ayscoughfee Hall in Spalding, whose bookplate of arms, 1735, is at f. 2 b, and who has prefixed some notes on the poem (ff. 3-5), stating that he had the volume re-bound in 1728. The binding is of the Harleian pattern, crimson morocco, tooled. 9 X 6 in'.
